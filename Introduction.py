1. Introduction
    1.1. What is Python
        - Python is a programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
        - It is used for:
            - web development (server-side)
            - software development
            - mathematics
            - system scripting
    1.2. What can Python do
        - Python can be used on a server to creat web application
        - Python can be used along side software to create workflows
        - Python can connect to database systems. Its can also read and modify files
        - Python can be used to hanlde big data and perform comple mathematics
        - Python can be used for rapod prototyping, or for production-ready software development
    1.3. Why python
        - Python works on different platforms (window, mac, linux, raspberry pi, etc..)
        - Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language
        - Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer line than some other language
        - Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
           --> this mean that prototyping can be very quick
        - Pythone can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or functional way.
    1.4. Good to know
        - Python 3 is mose rencet major version.
        - Python 2 not being updated with anything, but it is still quite popular.
    1.5. Python syntax compared to other programming languages
        - Python was designed for readability, and has some similarites to the english language with influence form mathematics
        - Python uses new line to complete a com,and, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
        - Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scopes of loops, functions and classes.
            other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
