1. Syntax
    1.1 Execute python syntax
        - Command line
        - creating python file on the server and run it in command line
    1.2. Python indentation
        - Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line
        - Where in other programming language the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in python is very important.
        --> Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation
        - The numbers of spaces is up to you as a programer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one
        - You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise python give you an error
    1.3. Variables
        - Variables are created when you assign a value to it.
        - Python has no command for declaring a variable
    1.4. Comments
        - Pythons has commmeting capability for the purpose of in code documentation
        - Comments start with a #, and python will render the rest of the line as a comment
        - Comments can be use to explain python code, make the code more readable, prevent execution when testing code
        - Multiline comments:
        - Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variables, 
        -->you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it
2. Variables
    2.1. Creating variables
        - Python has no command for declaring a variable
        - A variable is created the moments you first assign a value to it
         e.g:
            x = 5
            y = "Jone"
            print(x)
            print(y)
        - Variable do not need to be declared with any particular type,
            and can even change type after they have been set.
    2.2. Casting
        - If you want to specify the data tyoe if a variable, this can be done with casting
        - e.g:
            x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
            y = int(3)    # y will be 3
            z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
    2.3 Get the type
        -Y
